# anomalyDetection
Machine learning research project focused on one class SVM. The purpose of this project is to explore how diferent factors - especially hyperparameters - affect ocsvm models. The goal is to determine how to systemically determine the hyperparameters that will result in the best model.

ocSVM.py is a practice pipeline for one class svm hyperparameter optimization using the iris practice dataset (included as csv). 
It uses numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn

JB_functions_ocIris.py contains functions and function descriptions I wrote that were useful for several different approaches. This file is imported to individual analysis.
