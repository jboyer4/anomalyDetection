Machine learning project focused on one class SVM

ocSVM.py is a practice pipeline for one class svm hyperparameter optimization using the iris practice dataset (included as csv). 
It uses numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn

JB_functions_ocIris.py contains functions and function descriptions I wrote that were useful for several different approaches. This file is imported to individual analysis.
